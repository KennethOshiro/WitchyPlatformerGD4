# WitchyPlatformerGD4
A fork of Miziziziz's Witchy Platfformer, ported to Godot 4


Note: The game does run in the editor, but I'm still seeing some errors happening in the debugger.

So this isn't exactly 100% finished. If I get around to fixing the errors, I will update this repo.

As with my other projects, this game is tested with Godot 4, Alpha 14. 


EDIT: Updated to Alpha 16. Haven't fixed the errors yet but the level looks a bit nicer.
